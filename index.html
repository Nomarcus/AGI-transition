    // Slide 1 ‚Äì Introduction to AI (robot image)
`Welcome! This site offers a short guided journey into the world of artificial intelligence.
We‚Äôll move step by step‚Äîfrom the tools you already use today to big ideas about what might come next.
The goal is to explain, in clear everyday language, one widely discussed hypothetical path‚Äîfrom today‚Äôs AI to AGI and ASI, so even if these terms are new, you leave with a simple, solid picture of this possible journey.
USe the arrows to navigate this presentation`,

    // Slide 2 ‚Äì Exponential Development (curve + three cards)
`This graph shows the hypothetical idea about AGI and ASI.
On the left is today‚Äôs AI progress‚Äîit‚Äôs moving fast but still under control.
Around the middle, the curve steepens‚Äîthis is where when we reach the breakpoint of (AGI)
shortly this is the point where AI reach and start to exceeds human level of thinking and when AI can learn and improve on its own.
After that, the line shoots almost straight up, as each advance could speed up the next and create an ‚Äúintelligence explosion.‚Äù
The dates are only rough guesses.
The key message: progress is quick but manageable today, yet once we reach AGI it could accelerate almost vertically`,


// Slide 3 ‚Äì ANI (matches bullets + image)
`Today we live with Artificial Narrow Intelligence, or ANI‚Äîthe everyday AI behind tools like ChatGPT, image generators, and self-driving cars.  
These systems are lightning-fast and precise but each is built for one job only.
For example a photo generator can‚Äôt drive a car, and a driving system can‚Äôt write a song. 
We are in a transition wave right now, where intelligent AI agents begin to link these single skills together‚Äîin and be more multimodals agents.
It‚Äôs a bridge from today‚Äôs narrow experts toward the broader, more flexible intelligence that called AGI.`,

// Slide 4 ‚Äì AGI (matches four bullet points)
`Now to AGI‚Äîshort for Artificial General Intelligence.    
Many researchers view AGI as a true breakpoint in the history of technology: the moment when artificial intelligence matches and even surpasses the general knowledge of humans.  
Imagine an AI that learns quickly like a human, reasons and plans across different tasks, understands context and nuance, and generalizes knowledge to new situations.  
Instead of retraining for every job, it could pick up a new field by reading, practicing, and transferring what it already knows. This will lead us to next era`,

// Slide 5 ‚Äì AGI Capabilities (narrative)
`If Artificial General Intelligence ever becomes real, everyday life could feel profoundly different.  
Picture waking each morning with a silent partner that already knows how you slept and what your body needs.  
A personal doctor powered by AGI watches over your voice, your heartbeat, the tiny signals from wearable sensors, 
and quietly suggests care long before a symptom appears.  
In research labs, an AGI scientist spends the night designing multi-year experiments and by dawn delivers polished papers ready for publication.  
Entire cities might run on plans drafted by an AGI project manager that coordinates renewable-energy networks across a hundred urban centers.  
Even in ordinary offices, the dull routines of scheduling, budgeting, and endless email could vanish totally‚Äîfreeing people to focus on imagination, on relationships, and on the big ideas that only humans can bring.`,

    // Slide 6 ‚Äì ASI (matches four bullet points exactly)
`Beyond AGI lies something even more astonishing: Artificial Superintelligence, or ASI.  
Think of it as a kind of mind that could outthink the best human experts in every field‚Äîscience, art, engineering, anything you can imagine.  
Its thoughts might race a thousand times faster than ours, never forget a detail, and work on millions of ideas at once.  
Because it could redesign and improve itself, each upgrade would make the next come even faster and keep doing this to infinite.`,


// Slide 7 ‚Äì ASI Capabilities (narrative)
`Artificial Superintelligence would push the possibilities far beyond anything we can now grasp.  
Imagine a mind that designs and tests a life-saving medicine in the time it takes to brew a cup of coffee.  
While it does that, it may also engineer a planet-scale climate plan with the precision of a watchmaker.  
or It could discover new physical laws in a single afternoon and guide autonomous craft across interstellar space at the same time.
These images are still speculative, but they capture the speed, the reach, and the breathtaking creativity suggested by the word ‚Äúsuperintelligence.
This vision is thrilling to imagine but it also raises profound questions: if a machine becomes far smarter than us, how do we guide it and keep its goals aligned with our own?"`,


// Slide 8 ‚Äì Ongoing and Forward (narrative)
`The story of AI‚Äôs future is not only a tale of faster chips and clever code‚Äîit is also a deeply human, global project.  
In research labs, scientists focus on safety and alignment, working to build systems we can trust.  
Lawmakers debate how to guide these tools, crafting frameworks such as the European Union‚Äôs AI Act while other regions shape their own rules.  
Meanwhile, companies pour billions into GPUs, vast cloud networks, and the frontier models that will run on them.  
Schools and universities rethink how to prepare students for careers where intelligent systems are everyday partners.  
And across the world, nations and corporations both compete and collaborate‚Äîracing to lead the AI era while also sharing knowledge to prevent misuse.  
Progress, in other words, is as much about our choices and our values as it is about the technology itself.`,


    // Slide 9 ‚Äì Final Question (heading + image + prompt)
`We end with a question, not an answer. Are we riding the crest of an AI bubble at its peak‚Äîor simply witnessing the start of an intelligence surge?
Optimists see rapid breakthroughs; skeptics warn of hype, hard limits, and hidden risks.
The future will be shaped by choices we make together‚Äîin research labs, in policy, and in daily use.
What future do you want to build?`
